## Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model
### Project Overview
Welcome to the SageMaker deployment project! In this project I constructed a recurrent neural network for the purpose of 
determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. I created this model using Amazon's SageMaker 
service. In addition, I deployed my model and constructed a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.

### Project Instructions
The deployment project which I worked on is intended to be done using Amazon's SageMaker platform.
